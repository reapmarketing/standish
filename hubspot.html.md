### Modified Code

	<p id="form"> </p>
	<script>
		hbspt.forms.create({ 
			portalId: '239485',
			formId: 'e1c82df0-cb33-4f66-8f8c-3f6b78660f60',
			css: ''
		});
	</script>

Removed: `<script charset="utf-8" src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/current.js"></script>`
The forms JavaScript is already included by the template.

Added: `, css: ''` (Don't forget to fix the commas)
This stops the HubSpot form from importing its own styles, which will mess up our custom styles, the footer form, and any modal forms.

### Original Code

	<p id="form"> </p><script charset="utf-8" src="//js.hsforms.net/forms/current.js"></script>
